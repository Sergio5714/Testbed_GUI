# Graphic user interface for a testbed
The main goal of the software is to provide a comfortable graphic user interface for an experimental tested. There are a few temperature sensors and an external ADC that gather data in real time. This data should be gatheres from STM32 board via UART interface, visualized and saved as a txt file in a specified format.
